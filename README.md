###### Manual Testing :  
Manual testing involves humans testing and interacting with a software application or product to identify issues.
The purpose of manual testing is to catch bugs and feature issues before a software application goes live. When manually testing, the tester validates the key features of a software application. Analysts execute test cases and develop summary error reports.
- Here I have manually tested startech.com.bd website.This document provides a structured
  framework for systematically assessing the functionality, usability, compatibility,
  performance and security aspects of the website.

- **Features To Be Tested:**
* Register
*  Log in

The testing approach for the star .com.bd webpage will enclose an extensive evaluation
of its features, functionalities, and performance across various dimensions. 
* i) Functionality Testing
* ii) Usability Testing
* iii) Compatibility Testing
* iv) Performance Testing
* v) Security Testing
* vi) Error Handling and Recovery Testing
* vii) Accessibility Testing

As part of Functional Testing, we will follow the below approach for Testing:
* Equivalence Class Partition 
* Boundary Value Analysis
* Decision Table Testing
* State Transition Testing
* Use Case Testing

**As part of the Testing, we will perform the below types of Testing:**
* Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing
* Regression Testing and Retesting
* Usability Testing, Functionality & UI Testing

**We repeat Test Cycles until we get the quality product**

**Fixing Bugs:**

  During the testing process, the testing team will diligently identify and document
  defects (bugs) encountered while evaluating this webpage
* Defect description
* Steps to reproduce the defect Expected behavior
* Actual behavior
* Severity and priority levels

**Test Resource:**

* Human Resources
  The following human resources will be involved in testing the startech.com.bd
  webpage
* Testing Team:
   QA Analysts: Responsible for designing and executing test cases, and reporting defects.
* Development Team and Stakeholders

**Test Environment**

* Operating System: Windows 11
* Internet Browser: Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge
* Mind Map: XMind
* Test Case Track: Microsoft Excel
* Test Case Execute: Manual

The successful completion of the testing process would not have been possible without
the collaborative efforts of the testing team, development team, stakeholders, and all
involved parties. The dedication, expertise, and commitment demonstrated by each
team member have contributed to the enhanced quality of the startech.com.bd webpage.
